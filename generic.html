								<h2  style="color:blue" >Research/Academic Projects</h2>
								<h3 style="color:orange"><a href="https://github.com/dream-lab/fedml-bench"/>Characterizing the Performance of Accelerated Edge Devices for Training Deep Learning Models</h3>
								<p>Studied the impact of various training parameters on resource utilization, training time and energy, identified bottlenecks and resource inter-dependencies</p>
								<h3 style="color:orange"><a></a>An exploration of system virtualization on the edge</h3>
								<p>Carried out detailed CPU, memory, network and disk benchmarking on single and co-located KVM and Firecracker virtual instances on Nvidia Jetson NX to understand the overheads of virtualization</p>
								<h3 style="color:orange"><a href="https://github.com/dream-lab/ElfStore-v2/tree/elfstore-find"/>Elfstore: A Resilient Data Storage Service for Federated Edge and Fog Resources</h3>
								<p>Worked on simulating state transition diagrams and evaluating them on various performance metrics to ensure
									optimal utilization of storage while guaranteeing a given reliability</p>
								<h3 style="color:orange"><a href="https://github.com/prakadambi/mpprojfinal"/> A comprehensive assistive system for the visually impaired</h3>
								<p> Color and pattern recognition of fabrics, OCR on menu and visiting cards, face detection with voice input and output implemented on a Pi intended to be used as a wearable system.</p>
								<h3 style="color:orange"><a href="https://github.com/prakadambi/lirc_demo"/>Device Driver for Controlling a Projector using a Raspberry Pi</h3>
								<p>Kernel modules were created to detect the HDMI unplug uevent and transmit the hexcodes for powering off the projector connected to the Pi.</p>
								<h3 style="color:orange"><a href="https://github.com/prakadambi/idcproj"/>Remote Warehouse Monitoring</h3>
								<p>The iRobot moves autonomously collecting information from various sensors which is then periodically transmitted to a server and thereafter the cloud for further monitoring.</p>
								<h3 style="color:orange"><a href="https://github.com/SvrAdityaReddy/Arm_Expression_Compiler"/>Expression Compiler for ARM</h3>
								<p>Developed a compiler that reads input from a file and generates assembly instructions for ARM Cortex M4. Handled arithmetic, logical, relational and shift operators, assignment statements, if-then-else block.</p>
								<h3 style="color:orange"><a href="https://github.com/prakadambi/voip-rtp"/>Implementation of a real-time VoIP phone</h3>
								<p>The client and server sides of a VoIP phone were implemented. Used PulseAudio to pick up voice packets and G711 to encode. A periodic scheduler was integrated with real-time protocol to ensure good response time.</p>
								<h3 style="color:orange"><a></a>Smart object finder using Bluetooth</h3>
								<p>A small Bluetooth tag is attached to the objects of interest and an android app on the userâ€™s phone is used to locate the object in an indoor environment.</p>


								<h2  style="color:blue">Industry Projects/Responsibilities</h2>
								<h3  style="color:orange"><a></a>GPU Scheduler Performance Analysis and Tuning</h3>
								<p>Identified and executed several PoC experiments to characterise the performance of scheduler. </br>
									Identified and fixed gaps that led to performance improvements of 5-20% on Gen9+ platforms across various benchmarks, and was awarded for the same.</p>
								<h3 style="color:orange"><a></a>Telemetry Lead, Graphics Kernel Mode Driver (Gen 9)</h3>
								<p>Resolved Live Kernel Events (BSODs,TDRs) using kernel crash dumps received as part of telemetry data.
									</br>Added instrumentation that could help in effective debug without reproduction steps.</p>
								<h3 style="color:orange" ><a></a>Kernel Mode Driver Lead, Revenue Products</h3>
								<p>Contributed to the development and testing of several features in the Driver and Scheduler firmware.
									</br>Debugged and resolved critical launch-blocking OEM bugs in Media firmware and Graphics scheduler.</p>
